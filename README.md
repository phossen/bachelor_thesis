# Dealing with Concept Drifts via Weightless Neural Networks

This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis.
The Goal is to deal with concept drifts in WiSARD, in particular investigating the role of incremental update and unlearning for different data streams. 

Parts of this repository are based on the implementation of Douglas O. Cardoso: https://bitbucket.org/douglascardoso/ecmlpkdd2016/src/master/
